# Gumtree UK 'Freebies' Webscraper v0.1a


This is the first attempt at my first webscraper made from scratch. This takes desired "keywords" to be searched
for on Gumtree Freebies. If a search term was found, the title is returned. It will keep searching every so often,
and this period can be defined in how_long_for_hrs and interval_seconds. I only have a small amount of coding
experience, so there will almost certainly be bugs.

The idea is that you run the code as a .py file, and using BeautifulSoup the live Gumtree UK Freebies are obtained and are checked against a list of key words you're looking to match.

The point of this is a self development exercise to learn to manage code and improve on my organisational skills. I welcome any feedback or suggestions of course :)
